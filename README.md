### Usage

Place target ip addresses in .txt or .log files in the /in/ 
directory. One IP per line.

When 'scan 1' is true, Python must be run as sudo since it is using nmap.

Scan 1 - nmap "quick" scan \
Scan 2 - undefined \
Scan 3 - ARIN lookup 

### Pre-requisites (Important or this will not work!)

- Network connectivity, assuming target is outside of local machine
- nmap installed and callable
- sudo privileges
